	<p>
		The rules of the game are quite simpleâ€”it's essentially a variation of four-in-a-row. You click
		on the button corresponding to the field you want from a distance. After the first team's turn,
		the second team takes its turn and clicks on a field, regardless of whether it has been chosen
		by another team before. The current team is indicated at the top of the game interface. The game
		proceeds with each team taking turns until one team successfully forms four squares in a row or
		column. If you click on the same field four times in a row, a message will appear notifying you
		of this. When a team wins, the values of the fields reset, and a new round begins automatically,
		with the teams alternating. These rules apply universally to all games.

	<h2 id="precision">Precision</h2>

	<p>
		The aim of this golf game "Precision" is to retain as many points as possible out of the initial
		100 points by executing precise shots. For each shot, the deviation of the ball from the target
		distance is measured.
		<br />
		<br />
		Precision is measured by the deviation in {measurement_unit} from the target distance. The closer
		the ball is to the specified distance, the fewer points will be deducted. It follows a deduction
		of 1 point per {removeLastSymbol(measurement_unit)} deviation from the target.
		<br />
		<br />
		At the end of the game, the player who has retained the highest score out of the initial 100 points
		is declared the winner. This means that the individual with the highest score due to deductions emerges
		as the victor! Fairness and respect towards other players are paramount. Be sure to adhere to the
		rules and etiquette of the game, as well as the guidelines of the club.
		<br />
		<br />
		You can make the game more interesting by introducing additional challenges, such as playing in different
		weather conditions or on various terrains. Whether you are a novice or an experienced golfer, "Precision"
		offers an exciting opportunity to demonstrate your skills and precision. Enjoy the game and the company
		of your fellow players!
